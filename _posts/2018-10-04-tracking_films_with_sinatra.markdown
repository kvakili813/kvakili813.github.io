Coding the Sinatra Portfolio Project was much more intuitive for me than the CLI Gem. This was mainly due to the fact that I could visualize each part of the code by utilizing `shotgun` to view the app in my browser. Also, I continued to carry on a lesson I learned from the first project: keep it simple.

By reviewing the course videos, I was able to effectively set up the application structure. This gave me the confidence to begin coding as it provided a step by step guideline for writing the application controller file. I am realizing that the most difficult part of these projects is just simply starting. It was also extremely helpful to have done the Fwitter lab prior to the project  to provide a model for the portfolio project.

My main issue involved the routing protocol. So, I knew I had to focus on gaining a better understanding of the various action verbs such as `get`, `post` and `patch`. By breaking the down the concept of each action, I developed a firm understanding of when and how to use each action. Furthermore, by viewing the browser and code side by side, I gained comfort in learning more about how the entire application communicates with itself.
