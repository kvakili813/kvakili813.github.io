This final project was by far the most I've struggled throughout the entire course. Unlike the other sections, for some reason I did not find React to be as intuitive as the other languages. I discovered that React's nature is quite abstract compared to the rest. Most of my time was spent understanding the proper set up of imports in each file. 

The concept of 'props' vs. 'state' took some time getting used to. After getting past the React fundamentals, Redux was a completely new territory. By realizing it is merely a flow paradigm of how to organize data immensely helped.

Overall, I was reinforced with the fact that I am a visual learner and viewing video tutorials provided great guidance to me. I also focused on creating a simple app with a not so complicated database. By keeping things simple, I was able to dive deeper into the concepts and more effectively understand how everything worked together.
