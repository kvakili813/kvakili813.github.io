This was the most challenging project thus far. I felt ilke the roadblocks were endless, but it forced me to take advantage of different resources. I definitely gained more of an independent attitude and exposed myself to new tools that will be beneficial throughout my career.

Once I realized that what I was doing with JavaScript was similar to parts of Ruby and Rails and the main difference being syntax, I felt more confident in understanding how JavaScript works. The main challenge was developing an understanding of AJAX and JSON. The more I code, the more I realize that I quickly understand how things are working at a high level, but I struggle with discussing the details of how things are working. 

The details became clearer to me when I grasped how to utilize the console in the browser. I preferred using `debugger` as opposed to `binding.pry`. The fact that I was able to see what happened to my code the instance I would interact with a button was quite enjoyable. Ultimately, I feel like most of my time is spent on debugging and following the trace of code. This project allowed me to make great strides in that aspect and I definitely feel like progress is being made.
