With this project I began to feel like true developer. I felt more in command of the concepts and gained more confidence in the details. While Rails does provide more tools out of the gate and somewhat simplifies the overall structure, I learned it was even more important to understand what each part of the code was doing, since it was quite easy to get lost in the pre-packaged environment of Rails.

It was also nice to see some overlap of concepts from Sinatra. The two main challenges I experienced with Sinatra were routes and forms. By overcoming those hurdles previously I believe I had a strong foundation in approaching Rails. I would be remiss if I did not mention that I enjoyed utilizing the `rails generate ...` functionality, as it immensely sped things up and allowed to focus on the code and all the parts worked together.

Beyond the routes and forms, the main challenge I experienced with this project was implementing the `omniauth` strategy to overcome the authentication issue. I scanned various documentation and revisited lessons, but after dozens of refactors nothing seemed to work. I realized I had to think outside the box. And by coming across a gem named `Figaro` I was finally able to resolve my issue. It was definitely an important lesson to learn that you do not always need to follow all the rules if you can find alternatives to satisfy the requirements.
