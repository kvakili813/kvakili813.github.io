With the culmination of my bootcamp experience and having 5 web apps built from scratch under my belt, I have gained a new found confidence in myself and feel more prepared than ever for the future. Coming into this bootcamp, I was just focused on gaining a better understanding of programming principles, but ended up greatly enjoying the process of coding.

To me, coding offered a new way of thinking. At it's core, code is meant to simplify processes and behavior. Over the span of the course, I realized I was learning more when I kept things simple. That approach enabled me to focus on the flow of how web applications are structured and what the best practices. I knew that if I grasped a strong understanding on a simpler level, then I could always use that foundation to apply the same concepts to more complex structures.

While my focus for the past year has been on the screen, I have learned how important effective communication is in the coding world. There a myriad of ways to accomplish one method or solution, but the goal is to figure out the simplest and cleanest way to do it. That can only be done if communication between team members is clear and concise.

I am glad I chose Flatiron School to be my guide in this journey. Their mission of giving access to anyone who wants to learn programming is encouraging and their dedicated team reinforces that grand mission.
