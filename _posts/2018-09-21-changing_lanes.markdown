My decision to embark on this journey came after many back and forth discussions with friends and family. I have always had a deep curiosity for various fields and found it difficult to commit myself to just one area for my career. I realized that I needed to search for a path that was dynamic, challenging and rewarding. Technology has such a broad scope that I felt I would still be able to remain involved in all the other professional spaces that I feel excited about.

Initially, I began scouring the web for free resources on programming and quickly found myself constantly entering a cyclical trajectory. After further research and deliberation as a result of speaking with friends in the profession, I decided a coding bootcamp was the right decision for me. 

The next step was making sure that I would be able to do work that I would be passionate about. I knew I wanted my undertaking of programming to complement my academic background in political science.  The priority of combining my degree in humanities with a proficiency in full stack development gave me a new found purpose and set a tangible goal for me to achieve.

The time to change lanes is when you see an opening and have an exit in mind.
